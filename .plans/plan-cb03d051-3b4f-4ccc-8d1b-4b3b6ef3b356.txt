🌳 "MCP Memory Server Implementation"
📝 Implement a MCP server for Claude's memory functions with:
- CLI arg for root path (default: /home/claude/memory/)
- stdio and streamable http transport (default: stdio)
- Concurrent access support for multiple Claude instances
- Simple, minimal, elegant implementation
